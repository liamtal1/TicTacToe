Dear reader hello :D

in order to play our little game, you will need to clone it to your computer,
then you will need to install the relevant dependancies via:
npm i 

in order to start the server so you can enjoy yourself ;)   you will do:
npm start

then on all the web browsers you can open, go to:   http://localhost:3000/

once you are there, insert a name, wait for the second player to enter his/hers name 
and start enjoying the game (make sure that you win, because we hate loosers)

after the game is over, the browser will refresh and render a new game.


****** note for developers that are reading this, this is not using state mecanism 
****** therefore if the user exit the game by closing/refreshing the tab, the second user is stuck in the game alone (sad smiley)
****** will improve it one day, keep updated for later upgrades :)
